        <p>The Hope Cup will start with the Group stage. There are 3 groups. The first four places in group A and B can enter the knockout stage. The last places in group A and B will have a game and the lose side will have a game with the first place in group C as the promotion and relegation match. The winner will be in the level A for next season and the loser will be in the level B for the next season. </p>

        <h2>Personal Experience</h2>
        <p>I entered the department team after our journey as the second runner-up in 2018 Newcomer Cup. I got the chance as the substitute of left-back in the game vs Agriculture and Design Joint Team on April 2018. The Hope Cup in 2019 was largely affected by the pandemic and I start to play the substitute right-back in the Fall of 2021 and we got the sixth place in Hope Cup from 2019 - 2020.</p>

            <p> I opened Hope Cup debut. We entered the break by 1:1. I substituted as the left-back at 61'. But I felt I was not fully ready for the intensity of the Hope Cup and we conceded three goals in 9 minutes and lost the game.</p>

        <div class= "report">
            <img src="images/hope_cup_2020_electrical_team_photo.jpg" alt="team photo after the match" />
            <p> We began the game with the number difference of 1 and goal difference of 2. But we made a good defence for the next 70 minutes. The first place team in our group can hardly have good chance for shooting</p>

            <p> Even our opponent ranked the last place in our group. They still gave us a big surprise by defeating us with 5-0. Their forward had a strong dribbling skill and destroyed our defence.</p>

            <p> The last game for department team. We got a 0:3 lose and secured the sixth place for this season Hope Cup. </p>
