            <p> A strong opponent. The opponent had a good defence so we could only try to make long shots. Both teams were hard to score a goal. We ended with a tie.  </p>

            <p>Our opponent for consolation is Paris High-Tech Engineer Institute. They scored a penalty kick in the very early stage of the game. In the second half, one in our teams got his second yellow card because he complained about the referees. But our captain Tong scored an equalizer at the last ten seconds of the injury time. We managed to drag the game into penalty shootout even with six people. I made the penalty kick for the third round and the eighth round. Our opponent missed the eighth one. We finally got the third place in NewCommer Cup.</p>
